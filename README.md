# Doki Doki Hackathon Club

Project for 2018 Hack {中国}.

## Plot and gameplay

This is basically a Hackathon simulator. In prepare stage you need to prepare environment and supply while you are forced to face randomly choosed challenges and a randomly generated financial situation. Then in action stage you are going to make orders to keep all contestants working and process emergency events with your not-very-enough staff. 

## Implementation

The very first prototype (and itself as the presentation) is implemented in Microsoft PowerPoint 2016, and graphics are created using MS Paint, Paint 3D and Windows Ink Workspace. All work is done on a Surface Pro 3 (i5/4GiB version).

This repository is created on a MacBook Pro using Info-ZIP since the Hackathon organizer said they want some sort of "code". So I unzipped the PowerPoint file and gave them these XMLs.
